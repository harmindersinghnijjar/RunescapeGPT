# RunescapeGPT: Runescape's First Open-Source GPT-powered Python Bot

RunescapeGPT is an advanced conversational AI designed to assist with writing clean and concise Java code for DreamBot's Old School RuneScape (OSRS) botting scripts. Leveraging the latest discussions and code examples from the DreamBot forums, RunescapeGPT stays current with the best practices and most efficient methodologies in OSRS bot development.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Engage with RunescapeGPT in natural language to discuss your DreamBot script needs.
- **Code Generation**: Generate Java code snippets for DreamBot that are clean, concise, and ready to use.
- **Learning Model**: Continually updated with the latest DreamBot forum posts to improve code recommendations.
- **OSRS Integration**: Designed with the specific mechanics and features of OSRS in mind for highly relevant script generation.

## How It Works

RunescapeGPT uses a custom-trained model based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to understand and generate Java code. It processes the text from DreamBot forum threads, creating an embedded knowledge base that the AI uses to generate responses and code snippets.

### Code Generation

To generate code, interact with RunescapeGPT through its conversational interface. Simply describe the functionality you're aiming for, and RunescapeGPT will provide you with a Java code snippet that you can directly implement in your DreamBot script.

### Training

RunescapeGPT is periodically re-trained on the latest DreamBot forum posts, ensuring that its knowledge base is always up to date with the latest OSRS botting trends and coding practices.
